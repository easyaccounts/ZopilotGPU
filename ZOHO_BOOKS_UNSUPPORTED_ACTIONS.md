## ⚠️ PARTIALLY SUPPORTED / WORKAROUND REQUIRED (9)

These actions can be accomplished but require workarounds or manual journal entries:

### 1. **record_intercompany_transaction** ⚠️

**Issue:** Zoho Books doesn't have dedicated inter-company transaction module

**Workaround:**
- Option A: Use `POST /banktransactions` with descriptive notes
- Option B: Use `POST /journals` to manually post to Inter-Company Receivable/Payable accounts
- Option C: Create separate organization for each entity and use Zoho Books Multi-Organization feature (requires manual consolidation)

**Limitation:** No automatic inter-company reconciliation or elimination entries

**Effort:** Medium - Requires manual journal entries

---

### 2. **record_tax_payment** ⚠️

**Issue:** No dedicated "tax payment" endpoint

**Workaround:**
- Option A: `POST /expenses` with vendor = tax authority, account = Tax Payable
- Option B: `POST /journals` to debit Tax Payable, credit Bank Account
- Tax reporting available but payment must be recorded separately

**Limitation:** Tax payments not automatically linked to tax returns/filings

**Effort:** Low - Simple expense or journal entry

---

### 3. **record_tax_filing** ⚠️

**Issue:** Tax filing/return is informational, not a financial transaction

**Workaround:**
- Use `POST /journals` if there's a liability adjustment
- Use tax reports built into Zoho Books (GST, VAT) for filing data
- External tax filing with reference back to Zoho Books reports

**Limitation:** No tax return "document" or filing workflow within Zoho Books

**Effort:** Low - Journal entry if adjustment needed

---

### 4. **record_loan_proceeds** ⚠️

**Issue:** No dedicated loan/debt management module

**Workaround:**
- Use `POST /journals` to record:
  - Debit: Bank Account
  - Credit: Loan Payable (must create account in Chart of Accounts)
- Track loan in spreadsheet or external system

**Limitation:** No amortization schedule, no automatic payment tracking

**Effort:** Medium - Requires manual journal entry and external tracking

---

### 5. **record_debt_service_payment** ⚠️

**Issue:** No automatic principal/interest split

**Workaround:**
- Use `POST /journals` with 3 line items:
  - Debit: Loan Payable (principal)
  - Debit: Interest Expense (interest)
  - Credit: Bank Account (total)
- Calculate split externally (amortization schedule)

**Limitation:** No built-in amortization calculator or loan tracking

**Effort:** Medium - Requires external calculation

---

### 6. **reconcile_loan_balance** ⚠️

**Issue:** No loan reconciliation workflow

**Workaround:**
- Manually compare Loan Payable account balance to loan statement
- Create adjustment journal entry if discrepancy

**Limitation:** Fully manual process

**Effort:** Low - Comparison + potential journal entry

---

### 7. **record_capital_contribution** ⚠️

**Issue:** No equity management module

**Workaround:**
- Use `POST /journals`:
  - Debit: Bank Account
  - Credit: Owner's Equity or Share Capital
- Must manually track ownership percentages

**Limitation:** No cap table, no shareholder tracking

**Effort:** Low - Simple journal entry

---

### 8. **record_dividend_distribution** ⚠️

**Issue:** No dividend management

**Workaround:**
- Use `POST /journals`:
  - Debit: Dividends/Retained Earnings
  - Credit: Bank Account (if paid) or Dividends Payable (if declared)
- Track externally

**Limitation:** No dividend tracking, no per-shareholder allocation

**Effort:** Low - Simple journal entry

---

### 9. **record_depreciation_expense** ⚠️

**Issue:** Automatic depreciation available but not via API

**Workaround:**
- Option A: Use Zoho Books UI to set up automatic depreciation schedules
- Option B: Use `POST /journals` to manually record monthly depreciation:
  - Debit: Depreciation Expense
  - Credit: Accumulated Depreciation
- Depreciation auto-calculated by Fixed Assets module

**Limitation:** Cannot trigger depreciation posting via API

**Effort:** Low - Either UI setup or manual journal entry

---

## ❌ NOT SUPPORTED / MANUAL ENTRY REQUIRED (4)

These actions require significant workarounds or are not feasible in Zoho Books:

### 1. **capitalize_lease** ❌

**Issue:** Zoho Books has NO lease accounting module (ASC 842 / IFRS 16)

**Workaround:**
- Use external lease accounting software (e.g., LeaseQuery, Visual Lease)
- Manually calculate present value of lease payments
- Use `POST /journals` to record:
  - Debit: Right-of-Use (ROU) Asset
  - Credit: Lease Liability
- Track lease amortization schedule externally

**Limitation:** 
- No automatic lease capitalization
- No lease payment amortization
- No ROU asset depreciation automation
- Compliance risk for ASC 842 / IFRS 16 requirements

**Effort:** High - Requires external software or complex spreadsheets

**Impact:** Critical for businesses with significant leases (retail, offices, equipment)

---

### 2. **record_lease_payment** ❌

**Issue:** No lease payment split (principal vs interest)

**Workaround:**
- Calculate principal/interest split externally (using effective interest method)
- Use `POST /journals` with 3 line items:
  - Debit: Lease Liability (principal)
  - Debit: Interest Expense (interest)
  - Credit: Bank Account (total)
- Update remaining lease liability balance manually

**Limitation:** 
- Fully manual process
- Error-prone (incorrect calculations)
- No lease liability tracking

**Effort:** High - Monthly calculation required

**Alternative:** Treat as operating lease (simple rent expense) if lease term < 12 months

---

### 3. **record_short_term_lease** ✅ (Actually Supported)

**Correction:** This IS supported via `POST /expenses` or `POST /bills`

Just record as "Rent Expense" - no capitalization needed for short-term leases

**Effort:** Low

---

### 4. **record_grant_receipt** ⚠️ → ❌ (Complex)

**Issue:** No grant accounting module, deferred income tracking is manual

**Workaround:**
- For **unconditional grant** (immediate revenue):
  - Use `POST /journals`:
    - Debit: Bank Account
    - Credit: Grant Revenue
- For **conditional grant** (deferred):
  - Use `POST /journals`:
    - Debit: Bank Account
    - Credit: Deferred Grant Income (Liability)
  - Create recurring journal entry to recognize revenue monthly/quarterly
  - Track conditions externally

**Limitation:**
- No automatic revenue recognition based on conditions
- No grant tracking or compliance reporting
- Manual tracking of milestones/conditions

**Effort:** Medium to High - Requires external tracking and manual journal entries

**Impact:** Significant for non-profits, research institutions, or businesses with government grants

---

### 5. **match_grant_to_expenses** ❌

**Issue:** No grant-to-expense matching functionality

**Workaround:**
- Track eligible expenses in separate project or class (if using Zoho Books Advanced)
- Manually match and recognize grant revenue via journal entry
- Use custom fields or tags to link grant to expenses

**Limitation:**
- Fully manual process
- No automatic matching
- Compliance reporting requires external tools

**Effort:** High - Manual matching and tracking

---

### 6. **import_marketplace_settlement** ⚠️ → ❌ (Complex)

**Issue:** No dedicated e-commerce/marketplace settlement module

**Example:** Amazon seller settlement with gross sales, fees, refunds, net payout

**Workaround:**
- Parse settlement report externally
- Create multiple transactions:
  - Sales invoices for gross sales: `POST /invoices`
  - Expense transactions for fees: `POST /expenses`
  - Credit notes for refunds: `POST /creditnotes`
  - Bank deposit for net payout: `POST /banktransactions`
- Use journal entry to tie it all together if needed

**Limitation:**
- No atomic transaction (multiple API calls required)
- No built-in settlement matching
- Risk of double-entry if not careful

**Effort:** High - Requires custom parsing and orchestration logic

**Impact:** Critical for e-commerce businesses (Amazon, Shopify, Etsy sellers)

**Alternative:** Use Zoho Books integrations (e.g., Webgility, ConnectBooks) that handle marketplace settlements

---

### 7. **import_batch_report** ⚠️ → ❌ (Complex)

**Issue:** No batch import for complex reports (e.g., POS end-of-day, payroll batch)

**Example:** POS end-of-day with cash, credit card, refunds, discounts, tips

**Workaround:**
- Parse batch report externally
- Create multiple transactions via API:
  - Sales receipts: `POST /invoices` + `POST /customerpayments`
  - Refunds: `POST /creditnotes`
  - Expenses (if applicable): `POST /expenses`
- Use journal entry for complex allocations

**Limitation:**
- No atomic batch transaction
- Performance issues with many API calls
- Rate limiting concerns (100 calls/minute)

**Effort:** High - Custom integration required

**Impact:** Significant for retail/restaurant businesses with POS systems

**Alternative:** Use Zoho Books integrations with POS systems (e.g., Square, Clover integration)

---

### 8. **import_payroll_batch** ⚠️

**Issue:** Zoho Books has NO payroll module (use Zoho Payroll separately)

**Workaround:**
- Option A: Use Zoho Payroll (separate product) + integration
- Option B: Use `POST /journals` to record payroll summary:
  - Debit: Salary Expense, Payroll Tax Expense
  - Credit: Employee Net Pay Payable, Tax Payable, Bank Account
- Track payroll externally (spreadsheet, payroll service)

**Limitation:**
- No payroll processing in Zoho Books
- No employee records
- No payroll tax calculations
- Must use external payroll system

**Effort:** Low if using Zoho Payroll integration, High if manual

**Impact:** Moderate - Most businesses use external payroll anyway

---

## MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### For Actions with ⚠️ Partial Support:

1. **Create Journal Entry Templates** in Zoho Books UI
   - Pre-configure common journal entries (loan payments, depreciation, etc.)
   - Use API to POST journals with template structure

2. **Use Custom Fields & Tags**
   - Tag transactions with grant IDs, project codes, inter-company flags
   - Filter reports by tags for tracking

3. **External Tracking Spreadsheets**
   - Maintain loan amortization schedules in Google Sheets
   - Sync data to Zoho Books via API for GL posting

4. **Zoho Creator Custom Apps**
   - Build custom apps in Zoho Creator for loan tracking, grant management, etc.
   - Integrate with Zoho Books via Deluge scripting

---

### For Actions with ❌ No Support:

1. **Use Specialized Software + Integration**
   - Lease Accounting: LeaseQuery, Visual Lease → Export to Zoho Books
   - Marketplace: Webgility, ConnectBooks → Sync settlements
   - Payroll: Zoho Payroll, Gusto, ADP → Sync summary journal

2. **Build Custom Middleware**
   - Parse complex reports (marketplace settlements, POS EOD)
   - Orchestrate multiple Zoho Books API calls
   - Maintain referential integrity

3. **Consider Alternative Accounting Software**
   - QuickBooks Desktop: Better lease accounting support
   - NetSuite: Full lease, grant, inter-company modules
   - Xero: Better marketplace integrations

---

## ACTION PRIORITY FOR DEVELOPMENT

If building custom integrations, prioritize in this order:

### P0 - Critical (Build First)
1. ✅ Already supported - No dev needed
2. ⚠️ **import_marketplace_settlement** - High business impact for e-commerce
3. ⚠️ **import_batch_report** - High business impact for retail

### P1 - High Priority
4. ❌ **capitalize_lease** - Compliance requirement (ASC 842)
5. ❌ **record_lease_payment** - Ongoing monthly need
6. ⚠️ **record_intercompany_transaction** - Critical for multi-entity businesses

### P2 - Medium Priority
7. ⚠️ **record_grant_receipt** / **match_grant_to_expenses** - Specific to non-profits
8. ⚠️ **record_debt_service_payment** - Can be done manually with journal entry
9. ⚠️ **record_tax_payment** - Simple workaround exists

### P3 - Low Priority (Manual Entry Acceptable)
10. ⚠️ **record_capital_contribution** - Infrequent transaction
11. ⚠️ **record_dividend_distribution** - Infrequent transaction
12. ⚠️ **reconcile_loan_balance** - Quarterly/annual only

---

## CONCLUSION

Zoho Books provides **strong native support for 64% of classification system actions**, making it suitable for:
- ✅ Service businesses
- ✅ Simple product businesses
- ✅ Businesses with basic inventory
- ✅ Standard B2B invoicing workflows

**Significant gaps exist for:**
- ❌ E-commerce marketplace sellers (Amazon, Shopify)
- ❌ Retail/restaurant with POS systems
