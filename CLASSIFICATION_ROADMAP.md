# Classification System - Implementation Roadmap
## Addressing Critical Gaps

**Version:** 1.1 (Enhanced)  
**Date:** October 3, 2025

---

## Quick Summary: What's Missing?

### üî¥ **CRITICAL (Must Fix Before Production)**

1. **ACCRUALS & DEFERRALS** - No handling for:
   - Accrued expenses (utilities billed next month)
   - Deferred revenue (customer prepayments)
   - Prepaid expenses (annual insurance)
   - Accrued revenue (unbilled services)

2. **FOREIGN CURRENCY** - Multi-currency transactions ignored:
   - FX gains/losses not calculated
   - Currency conversion not tracked

3. **INTER-COMPANY TRANSACTIONS** - Related party transactions:
   - Will consolidate incorrectly
   - Transfer pricing issues

4. **BAD DEBT & WRITE-OFFS** - No provision for:
   - AR write-offs
   - Inventory obsolescence
   - Asset impairments

---

## üü° **HIGH PRIORITY (Needed for Complex Businesses)**

5. **LEASES (ASC 842/IFRS 16)** - Finance vs operating lease distinction
6. **REVENUE RECOGNITION (ASC 606)** - Performance obligations, percentage completion
7. **COGS & INVENTORY COSTING** - FIFO/LIFO, landed costs
8. **SALES TAX RECONCILIATION** - Collection vs remittance vs input tax

---

## üü¢ **MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have)**

9. **REFUNDS** (different from credit notes)
10. **EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ACCRUALS** (PTO, bonus, benefits)
11. **GRANTS & SUBSIDIES** (government grants, loan forgiveness)
12. **PROVISIONS** (warranty, legal, restructuring)

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Enhancements (2-3 weeks)

**Add 4 Critical Categories:**

### After Phase 1 (Critical):
- **Coverage:** ~85% of transactions
- **Misclassification Risk:** 10-15%
- **Manual Intervention:** Medium (15%)

### After Phase 2 (Compliance):
- **Coverage:** ~90% of transactions
- **Misclassification Risk:** 5-10%

### After Phase 3 (Complete):
- **Coverage:** ~95% of transactions

## Recommendation

**Minimum for Production:** Complete Phase 1 (Critical gaps)  
**Recommended for Production:** Complete Phase 1 + Phase 2  
**Gold Standard:** All 3 phases

**Timeline:**
- Phase 1: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 2: 3-4 weeks (cumulative: 5-7 weeks)
- Phase 3: 4-6 weeks (cumulative: 9-13 weeks)

**Effort vs Impact:**
- Phase 1: 30% effort, 60% impact improvement
- Phase 2: 40% effort, 30% impact improvement
- Phase 3: 30% effort, 10% impact improvement

**Start with Phase 1, measure results, then decide on Phase 2/3.**
